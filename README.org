[[https://github.com/rycee/home-manager][home-manager]] is an excelent [[https://nixos.org/nix/][Nix]] based dotfile management system. Not only can
it manage symlinks in your home-directory, as a package manager, it can also
install the related software. Win!

This project provides a wrapper around home-manager that makes it a little
easier to use.

My personal configuration used with home-manager-helper can be found [[https://github.com/dustinlacewell/dotfiles][here]].

** Quickstart
*** Install Nix

Install the Nix package manager to your workstation:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
#+END_SRC

This will create ~/nix~ as well as some system-wide profile scripts which will
integrate your shell with Nix.

*** Install home-manager-helper

Use ~nix-env~ to install the package straight from GitHub into your Nix profile:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  #> nix-env -i -f https://github.com/dustinlacewell/home-manager-helper/archive/master.tar.gz

  downloading ‘https://github.com/dustinlacewell/dotfiles/archive/master.tar.gz’...
  unpacking ‘https://github.com/dustinlacewell/dotfiles/archive/master.tar.gz’...
  installing ‘home-manager-helper’
  building path(s) ‘/nix/store/h1bb5hybayvkzbhg49kadd2s9irxrbxh-user-environment’
  created 1 symlinks in user environment
#+END_SRC

*** First-run Bootstrap

The ~hm~ command is now available. On the first run, it will install
~home-manager~:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  #> hm
  /Users/dustinlacewell/.nix-profile/bin/hm:hash:67: no such command: home-manager
  Home-manager was not found. It will now be installed.
  Press any key to continue...

  installing ‘home-manager’
  these derivations will be built:

  installing
  install: creating directory '/nix/store/h4gjwiwqqm4db7qf0rpqr6711bjcdkli-home-manager'

  building path(s) ‘/nix/store/wrfwl5rh0n3934wyj8pq7s79xc74a5df-user-environment’
  created 3 symlinks in user environment

  Bootstrap successful!
#+END_SRC

Woo.


** Using hm

~hm~ is super simple. It has two commands ~build~ and ~switch~. Both take a
single argument, the name of an envfile.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
usage: hm <command> <env>

Commands:
build  - build env to ./result/
switch - build env to ~/

Environments:
Loads ~/.home-manager/envs/<env>.nix
#+END_SRC

*** Building
To perform a dry-run use the ~build~ command. It creates a ~./result/~
directory with the files that would be symlinked into your home directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  #> hm build osx

  ...
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  #> tree ./result/

  ./result/
  ├── activate
  ├── home-files -> /nix/store/5x3dxzivrnh0lks5sc3fgfkcg4884xb1-home-manager-files
  └── home-path -> /nix/store/2scx60dwvx9fvi55cwcjmg39gd2ymvvl-home-manager-path

  2 directories, 1 file
#+END_SRC

*** Switching
Once you're satisfied with the dry-run output, use the ~switch~ command to
actually install symlinks into your home directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  #> hm switch osx

  ...
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  #> find ~/ -type l -ls | grep "nix/store"

#+END_SRC

** Hello World!

During the bootstrap, some example files were installed to your home directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  #> tree ~/.home-manager

  ├── envs
  │   ├── example.nix
  ├── hello
  │   ├── default.nix
  │   └── hello.conf
#+END_SRC

Go ahead and build a dry-run:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  #> hm build example
  /nix/store/fv3j0cn5np78wdl4bybfnb52mvqrrwjk-home-manager-generation
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  #> tree result/

  result/
  ├── activate
  ├── home-files -> /nix/store/cv68n6291xzdwqz3f7whlp3qg5vzm60g-home-manager-files
  └── home-path -> /nix/store/sq9x4x0k5va4fwr7q91wk7w74fp8jv1k-home-manager-path
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  ls -la result/home-files

#+END_SRC

Now go ahead and actually install these files to your home directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC text

** Protect your Secrets

So that you don't need to keep secrets in your configuration ~hm~ will source
~$HOME/.secrets~. This file should export any environment variables that you
utilize while building your configuration.

This file should probably not directly contain your secrets. We recommend
instead, utilizing a a tool to manage your secrets. The tool can be used to
interpolate secret values when the file is sourced. Some options might be:

  - GNU Pass: https://www.passwordstore.org/
  - Mozilla SOPS: https://github.com/mozilla/sops
  - LastPass CLI: https://github.com/lastpass/lastpass-cli

** Plugins

Plugins are defined in ~$HOME/.home-manager/plugins.nix~.

This expression contains a simple attrset. Each attribute is the name of a
plugin. Its value should be a NixOS package. The package can be fetched
dynamically using any of the following helpers:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  pkgs.fetchFromBitbucket  pkgs.fetchFromGitHub
  pkgs.fetchFromGitLab     pkgs.fetchFromRepoOrCz
  pkgs.fetchFromSavannah   pkgs.fetchHex
  pkgs.fetchMavenArtifact  pkgs.fetchNuGet
  pkgs.fetchRepoProject    pkgs.fetchadc
  pkgs.fetchbower          pkgs.fetchbzr
  pkgs.fetchcvs            pkgs.fetchdarcs
  pkgs.fetchegg            pkgs.fetchfossil
  pkgs.fetchgit            pkgs.fetchgitLocal
  pkgs.fetchgitPrivate     pkgs.fetchgitrevision
  pkgs.fetchgx             pkgs.fetchhg
  pkgs.fetchmail           pkgs.fetchmtn
  pkgs.fetchpatch          pkgs.fetchs3
  pkgs.fetchsvn            pkgs.fetchsvnrevision
  pkgs.fetchsvnssh         pkgs.fetchurl
  pkgs.fetchurlBoot        pkgs.fetchzip
#+END_SRC


** Envfiles
Envfiles are a top-level Nix expressions that live in ~$HOME/.config/nixpkgs/envs/~.

Their job is to import the other expressions which make up the environment. You
can have multiple envfiles, one for each unique environment. Take look at
~envs/osx.nix~ to see how I write mine:

#+BEGIN_SRC nix
  {
    imports = [
      ../src/ssh
      ../src/emacs
      ../src/zsh
      ../src/httpie
      ../src/aws
      ../src/fasd
    ];
  }
#+END_SRC

The expression is an attrset. The only attribute is ~imports~ set to a list of
paths of other expressions to load.

** Expression Sources
Expression Sources are Nix expressions that actually make up your
configuration. I organize these underneath ~$HOME/.config/nixpkgs/src/~. For
each tool I typically create a folder with a ~default.nix~ and any data files.

This is ~src/emacs/default.nix~ at the time of this writing:

#+BEGIN_SRC nix
  { pkgs, ... }: ①

  let
    plugins = import <plugins>; ②

  in {
    imports = [ ③
      plugins.org-build
      plugins.org-export
    ];

    programs.emacs = { enable = true; }; ④

    home.file.".emacs.d/init.el".source = pkgs.org-build { ⑤
      source = ./init.org;
    };

    home.file.".emacs.d/init.html".source = pkgs.org-export { ⑥
      source = ./init.org;
      user = "dustinlacewell";
      repo = "emacs.d";
    };
  }
#+END_SRC

*** ① Module function
The module is expressed as a function that accepts ~pkgs~ and returns an attrset.

*** ② Import plugins.nix
The expression at ~$HOME/.config/nixpkgs/plugins.nix~ is imported so that we
can refer to the plugin packages.

*** ③ Add plugins to imports
One of the attributes of our module's returned attrset is ~imports~. This takes
a list of modules that should be merged by the module system. This has the
effect of making available any Options declared or defined by the plugins. It
also makes any package overrides provided by the plugins available under
~pkgs~.

*** ④ Install Emacs
This line declares the ~programs.emacs.enable~ option to be true. This will
ensure Emacs gets installed the Nix profile.

*** ⑤ Build init.org
Emacs configuration is done with Emacs-Lisp. But I choose to write my
configuration as an Orgmode document. This section calls ~pkgs.org-build~
function which builds an Orgmode document into Emacs-Lisp. This returns the
path of the built ~.el~ file in the store. We assign that to
~home.file.".emacs.d/init.el".source~ which will cause the file to be symlinked
into our home directory.

*** ⑥ Export init.org
Similar to ⑤ this calls a plugin function. This time it is ~pkgs.org-export~
which builds ~init.org~ as HTML. This line writes out the HTML file to
~.emacs.d/init.html~ but ~org-export~ will also publish the HTML file to
http://dustinlacewell.github.com/emacs.d/
